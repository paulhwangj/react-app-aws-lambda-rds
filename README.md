## Purpose of Application
The purpose of the application was to be able to create a React application that would be connected to an API Gateway via Amazon API Gateway that would retrieve data from a MySQL instance being ran on AWS RDS. It would also allow the insertion of data into the database as well.

**Note:** This application utilized the existence of an API Gateway, Lambda function(s), and a MySQL AWS RDS instance; it may be the case that these instances no longer exist or are no longer running in which the application may not behave properly.
